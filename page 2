displaced fracture of the right distal radius.
The patient was laid in the supine position on the operating table. The right arm was prepped and
draped in the normal sterile fashion. Prior to the surgery the patient was given 1g of cefazolin
intravenously. A tourniquet was place on the upper arm and inflated to 250 mmHg. An incision
was made along the dorsal aspect of the forearm and subcutaneous tissue was dissected to reveal
the fractured radius. A curette was used to remove the splintered ends of the radius on each side
of the fracture and a K-wire was then introduced along the radius to stabilize it. A guide pin was
then placed down the central axis of the radius. A 20mm hole was then drilled and a screw was
introduced. The K-wire was then removed and the wound was thoroughly irrigated with normal
saline. The fascia layer was closed with absorbable sutures and the epidermis was closed with
Monocryl. The wound was dressed with Vaseline gauze, 4x4s, and sterile Sof-Rol. A long arm
Velcro splint was then placed over this and placed in a sling. The tourniquet was deflated after a
total time of 60 minutes. The patient was awakened, placed in his hospital bed, and taken to the
recovery room in fair condition.
Estimated blood loss was 15cc. Sponge and needle counts were correct.

Preoperative Diagnosis: Basal Cell Carcinoma
Postoperative Diagnosis: Basal Cell Carcinoma
Location: Mid Parietal Scalp
Procedure:
Prior to each surgical stage, the surgical site was tested for anesthesia and re-anesthetized as
needed, after which it was prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.
The clinically-apparent tumor was carefully defined and de-bulked prior to the first stage,
determining the extent of the surgical excision. With each stage, a thin layer of tumor-laden tissue
was excised with a narrow margin of normal appearing skin, using the Mohs fresh tissue
technique. A map was prepared to correspond to the area of skin from which it was excised. The
tissue was prepared for the cryostat and sectioned. Each section was coded, cut and stained for
microscopic examination. The entire base and margins of the excised piece of tissue were
examined by the surgeon. Areas noted to be positive on the previous stage (if applicable) were
removed with the Mohs technique and processed for analysis.
No tumor was identified after the final stage of microscopically controlled surgery. The patient
tolerated the procedure well without any complication. After discussion with the patient regarding
the various options, the best closure option for each defect was selected for optimal functional
and cosmetic results.

closed in a car door. The physician evaluates the patient and diagnosis her with a 3cm laceration
to her second finger and a subungual hematoma to her third finger. The physician then proceeds
to cleanse the fingers with an iodine scrub and injects both digits with 2 mL of 1% lidocaine with
epinephrine. The wound on the second finger was then irrigated with 500 cc of NS and explored
for foreign bodies or structural damage. No foreign bodies were found, tendons and vessels were
intact. The wound was then re-approximated. Three 5-0 absorbable mattress sutures were used to
close the subcutaneous tissue and six 6-0 nylon interrupted sutures were used to close the
epidermis. The finger was then wrapped in sterile gauze and placed in an aluminum finger splint.
The physician then check that the digital block performed on the third finger was still effective.
After ensuring the patient’s finger was still numb he then proceeded to take an electronic cautery
unit and created a small hole in the nail. Pressing slightly on the nail he evacuated the hematoma.
The hole was then irrigated with 500cc of NS and the finger was wrapped in sterile gauze. The
patient tolerated both procedures well without complaint.

PROCEDURE PERFORMED:
1. Anterior discectomy, C5-C6.
2. Arthrodesis, C5-C6.
3. Partial corpectomy, C5.
4. Machine bone allograft, C5-C6.
5. Placement of anterior plate with a Zephyr C6.
ANESTHESIA: General.
ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: 60 mL.
COMPLICATIONS: None.
INDICATIONS: This is a patient who presents with progressive weakness in the left upper
extremity as well as imbalance. He has a very large disc herniation that came behind the body at
C5 as well and as well as a large disc herniation at C5-C6. Risks and benefits of the surgery
including bleeding, infection, neurologic deficit, nonunion, progressive spondylosis, and lack of
improvement were all discussed. He understood and wished to proceed.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed
in the supine position. Preoperative antibiotics were given. The patient was placed in the supine
position with all pressure points noted and well padded. The patient was prepped and draped in
standard fashion. An incision was made approximately above the level of the cricoid. Blunt
dissection was used to expose the anterior portion of the spine with carotid moved laterally and
trachea and esophagus moved medially. I then placed needle into the disc spaces and was found
to be at C5-C6. Distracting pins were placed in the body of C6. The disc was then completely
removed at C5-C6. There was very significant compression of the cord. This was carefully
removed to avoid any type of pressure on the cord. This was very severe and multiple free
fragments noted. This was taken down to the level of ligamentum. Both foramen were then also
opened. Part of the body of C5 was taken down to assure that all fragments were removed and
that there was no additional constriction. The nerve root was then widely decompressed. Machine
bone allograft was placed into C5-C6 and then a Zephyr plate was placed in the body C6 with a
metal pin placed into the body at C5. Excellent purchase was obtained. Fluoroscopy showed good
placement and meticulous hemostasis was obtained. Fascia was closed with 3-0 Vicryl,
subcuticular 3-0 Dermabond for skin. The patient tolerated the procedure well and went to
recovery in good condition.

supine position. Following anesthesia, the surgical site was prepped and draped in the normal
sterile fashion. Attention was then directed to the right foot where, utilizing a # 15 blade, a 6 cm.
linear incision was made over the 1st metatarsal head, taking care to identify and retract all vital
structures. The incision was medial to and parallel to the extensor hallucis longus tendon. The
incision was deepened through subcutaneous underscored, retracted medially and laterally - thus
exposing the capsular structures below, which were incised in a linear longitudinal manner,
approximately the length of the skin incision. The capsular structures were sharply underscored
off the underlying osseous attachments, retracted medially and laterally. Utilizing an osteotome
and mallet the medial eminence of the metatarsal bone was removed and the head was remodeled
with the Liston bone forceps and the bell rasp. The surgical site was then flushed with saline. The
base of the proximal phalanx of the great toe was osteotomized approximately 1 cm distal to the
base and excised to toto from the surgical site. There was no hemi implant used and Kirschner
wire was used to hold the joint in place. Superficial closure was accomplished using Vicryl 5-0 in
a running subcuticular fashion. Site was dressed with a light compressive dressing. The
tourniquet was released. Excellent capillary refill to all the digits was observed without excessive
bleeding noted.

PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Angina and coronary artery disease.
POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Angina and coronary artery disease.
PROCEDURE DETAILS: The patient was brought to the operating room and placed in the
supine position upon the table. After adequate general anesthesia, the patient was prepped with
Betadine soap and solution in the usual sterile manner. Elbows were protected to avoid ulnar
neuropathy and phrenic nerve protectors were used to protect the phrenic nerve. All were
removed at the end of the case.
A midline sternal skin incision was made and carried down through the sternum which was
divided with the saw. Pericardial and thymus fat pad was divided. The left internal mammary
artery was harvested and spatulated for anastomosis. Heparin was given.
The Femoropopliteal vein was resected from the thigh, side branches secured using 4-0 silk and
Hemoclips. The thigh was closed multilayer Vicryl and Dexon technique. A Pulsavac wash was
done, drain was placed.
The left internal mammary artery is sewn to the left anterior descending using 7-0 running
Prolene technique with the Medtronic off-pump retractors. After this was done, the patient was
fully heparinized, cannulated with a 6.5 atrial cannula and a 2-stage venous catheter and begun on
cardiopulmonary bypass and maintained normothermia. Medtronic retractors used to expose the
circumflex. Prior to going on pump, we stapled the vein graft in place to the aorta.
Then, on pump, we did the distal anastomosis with a 7-0 running Prolene technique. The right
side graft was brought to the posterior descending artery using running 7-0 Prolene technique.
Deairing procedure was carried out. The bulldog clamps were removed. The patient maintained
good normal sinus rhythm with good mean perfusion. The patient was weaned from
cardiopulmonary bypass. The arterial and venous lines were removed and doubly secured.
Protamine was delivered. Meticulous hemostasis was present. Platelets were given for
coagulopathy. Chest tube was placed and meticulous hemostasis was present. The anatomy and
the flow in the grafts was excellent. Closure was begun.
The sternum was closed with wire, followed by linea alba and pectus fascia closure with running
6-0 Vicryl sutures in double-layer technique. The skin was closed with subcuticular 4-0 Dexon
suture technique. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the intensive
care unit in stable condition.

accomplished without difficulty and the guide wire was advanced and a dilator was advanced
over the wire. The triple lumen catheter was cannulated over the wire and the wire was then
removed. No PVCs were encountered during the procedure. All three ports to the catheter were
aspirated and flushed blood easily and they were all flushed with normal saline. The catheter was
anchored to the chest wall with butterfly phalange using 3-0 silk suture. Betadine ointment and a
sterile Op-Site dressing were applied. Stat upright chest x-ray was obtained at the completion of
the procedure to ensure proper placement of the tip in the subclavian vein.

millivolts. Impedance 572 ohms. Right ventricle threshold 0.9 volts at 0.5 milliseconds. R wave
10.3. Impedance 855.
Procedure: The patient was brought to the electrophysiology laboratory in a fasting state and
intravenous sedation was provided as needed with Versed and fentanyl. The left neck and chest
were prepped and draped in the usual manner and the skin and subcutaneous tissues below the left
clavicle were infiltrated with 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia. A 2-1/2-inch incision was made
below the left clavicle and electrocautery was used for hemostasis. Dissection was carried out to
the level of the pectoralis fascia and extended caudally to create a pocket for the pulse generator.
The deltopectoral groove was explored and a medium-sized cephalic vein was identified. The
distal end of the vein was ligated and a venotomy was performed. Two guide wires were
advanced to the superior vena cava and peel-away introducer sheaths were used to insert the two
pacing leads. The venous pressures were elevated and there was a fair amount of back-bleeding
from the vein, so a 3-0 Monocryl figure-of-eight stitch was placed around the tissue surrounding
the vein for hemostasis. The right ventricular lead was placed in the high RV septum and the right
atrial lead was placed in the right atrial appendage. The leads were tested with a pacing systems
analyzer and the results are noted above. The leads were then anchored in place with #0-silk
around their suture sleeve and connected to the pulse generator. The pacemaker was noted to
function appropriately. The pocket was then irrigated with antibiotic solution and the pacemaker
system was placed in the pocket. The incision was closed with two layers of 3-0 Monocryl and a
subcuticular closure of 4-0 Monocryl. The incision was dressed with Steri-Strips and a sterile
bandage and the patient was returned to her room in good condition.

The 45 year old male patient was taken to the operative suite, placed on the table in the supine
position, and given a spinal anesthetic. The right inguinal region was shaved, prepped, and draped
in a routine sterile fashion. The patient received 1 gm of Ancef IV push. A transverse incision
was made in the intraabdominal crease and carried through the skin and subcutaneous tissue. The
external oblique fascia was exposed and incised down to, and through, the external inguinal ring.
The spermatic cord and hernia sac were dissected bluntly off the undersurface of the external
oblique fascia exposing the attenuated floor of the inguinal canal. The cord was surrounded with a
Penrose drain. The sac was separated from the cord structures. The floor of the inguinal canal,
which consisted of attenuated transversalis fascia, was imbricated upon itself with a running
locked suture of 2-0 Prolene. Marlex patch 1 x 4 in dimension was trimmed to an appropriate
shape with a defect to accommodate the cord. It was placed around the cord and sutured to itself
with 2-0 Prolene. The patch was then sutured medially to the pubic tubercle, inferiorly to
Cooper’s ligament and inguinal ligaments, and superiorly to conjoined tendon using 2-0 Prolene.
The area was irrigated with saline solution, and 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine was injected to
provide prolonged postoperative pain relief. The cord was returned to its position. External

Procedure: After informed consent was obtained the patient was brought to the
endoscopy suite. He was placed in the supine position and was given IV sedation by the
Anesthesia Department. An EGD was performed from above by Dr. Brown who has
dictated his finding separately. The stomach was transilluminated and an optimal position
for the PEG tube was identified using the single poke method. The skin was infiltrated
with local and the needle and sheath were inserted through the abdomen into the stomach
under direct visualization. The needle was removed and a guidewire was inserted through
the sheath. The guidewire was grasped from above with a snare by Dr. Brown. It was
removed completely and the Ponsky PEG tube was secured to the guidewire. The
guidewire and PEG tube were then pulled through the mouth and esophagus and snug to
the abdominal wall. There was no evidence of bleeding. Photos were taken. The Bolster
was placed on the PEG site. A complete dictation for the EGD will be done separately by
Dr. Brown. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to recovery room
in stable condition. He will be started on tube feedings in 6 hours with aspiration and
dietary precautions to determine his nutritional goal.

Epidural anesthesia was administered in the holding area, after which the patient was
transferred into the operating room. General endotracheal anesthesia was administered,
after which the patient was positioned in the flank standard position. A left flank incision
was made over the area of the twelfth rib. The subcutaneous space was opened by using
the Bovie. The ribs were palpated clearly and the fascia overlying the intercostal space
between the eleventh and twelfth rib was opened by using the Bovie. The fascial layer
covering of the intercostal space was opened completely until the retroperitoneum was
entered. Once the retroperitoneum had been entered, the incision was extended until the
peritoneal envelope could be identified. The peritoneum was swept medially. The
Finochietto retractor was then placed for exposure. The kidney was readily identified and
was mobilized from outside Gerota’s fascia. The ureter was dissected out easily and was
separated with a vessel loop. The superior aspect of the kidney was mobilized from the
superior attachment. The pedicle of the left kidney was completely dissected revealing
the vein and the artery. The artery was a single artery and was dissected easily by using a
right-angle clamp. A vessel loop was placed around the renal artery. The tumor could be
easily palpated in the lateral lower pole to mid pole of the left kidney. The Gerota’s fascia
overlying that portion of the kidney was opened in the area circumferential to the tumor.
Once the renal capsule had been identified, the capsule was scored using a Bovie about
0.5 cm lateral to the border of the tumor. Bulldog clamp was then placed on the renal
artery. The tumor was then bluntly dissected off of the kidney with a thin rim of a normal
renal cortex. This was performed by using the blunted end of the scalpel. The tumor was
removed easily. The argon beam coagulation device was then utilized to coagulate the
base of the resection. The visible larger bleeding vessels were oversewn by using 4-0
Vicryl suture. The edges of the kidney were then reapproximated by using 2-0 Vicryl
suture with pledgets at the ends of the sutures to prevent the sutures from pulling through.
Two horizontal mattress sutures were placed and were tied down. The Gerota’s fascia
was then also closed by using 2-0 Vicryl suture. The area of the kidney at the base was
covered with Surgicel prior to tying the sutures. The bulldog clamp was removed and
perfect hemostasis was evident. There was no evidence of violation into the calyceal
system. A 19-French Blake drain was placed in the inferior aspect of the kidney exiting
the left flank inferior to the incision. The drain was anchored by using silk sutures. The
flank fascial layers were closed in three separate layers in the more medial aspect. The
lateral posterior aspect was closed in two separate layers using Vicryl sutures. The skin
was finally re-approximated by using metallic clips. The patient tolerated the procedure
well.

Pre-operative Diagnosis: Increased intracranial pressure and cerebral edema due to
severe brain injury.
Post operative Diagnosis: Increased intracranial pressure and cerebral edema due to
severe brain injury.
Procedure: Scalp was clipped. Patient was prepped with ChloraPrep and Betadine.
Incisions are infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine with epinephrine 1:200000. Patient did
receive antibiotics post procedure and was draped in a sterile manner. The incision made
just to the right of the right mid-pupillary line 10 cm behind the nasion. A self-retaining
retractor was placed. A hole was then drilled with the cranial twist drill and the dura was
punctured. A brain needle was used to localize the ventricle and it took 3 passes to
localize the ventricle. The pressure was initially high. The CSF was clear and colorless.
The CSF drainage rapidly tapered off because of the brain swelling. With two tries, the
ventricular catheter was then able to be placed into the ventricle and then brought out
through a separate puncture site; the depth of catheter was 7 cm from the outer table of
the skull. There was intermittent drainage of CSF after that. The catheter was secured to
the scalp with #2-0 silk sutures and the incision was closed with Ethilon suture. The
patient tolerated the procedure well. No complications. Sponge and needle counts were
correct. Blood loss is minimal.

141. A 5year old is brought into the ER after being attacked by a stray dog. The stray was
captured and tested positive for rabies. The patient has a 3cm laceration on his right
cheek that requires simple closure and a 1cm and 4cm laceration on his upper left arm
requiring layered repair. After discussing the benefits and risks with the patient’s parents
they decide to have an IM rabies vaccination administered by the physician, due to the
patient’s rabies exposure.

142. A 52 year old male is in the emergency department complaining of dizziness and states
he passed out prior to arrival. The physician evaluates him, orders that a 12 lead EKG be
performed, and has the nurse infuse 2 liters of NS over a 1 hour and 45 minute time
period under his supervision. The EKG results were reviewed by the physician and were
normal. A report was written and the patient was diagnosed with syncope due to
dehydration and released. In addition to the EM service what should the physician code

initiate remote monitoring of the ICD and of cardiovascular monitor functionality (within
the ICD), to help diagnosis the patient with what he suspects is left sided heart failure.
Over the course of 90 days the physician remotely analyzes recorded data from the
device, including left atrial pressure, ventricular pressure, and the patient’s blood
pressure. He also remotely analyzes data from the defibrillator, including the heart
rhythms and pace. After analysis and review the physician compiles reports on both.
During this time period there was also one in-person interrogation of the ICM device and
one in-person encounter for programming and adjusting the ICD device to ensure test
functions and to optimize programming.

macular degeneration. Patient has had laser four times to the macula on the right and two
times to the left.
Exam: Established 63 year old female patient. On examination, lids, surrounding tissues,
and palpebral fissure are all unremarkable. Conjunctiva, sclera, cornea and iris were all
assessed as well. Palpitation of the orbital rim revealed nothing. Visual acuity with
correction measured 20/400 OU. Manifest refraction did not improve this. There was no
afferent pupillary defect. Visual fields were grossly full to hand motions. Intraocular
pressure measured 17 mm in each eye. Vertical prism bars were used to measure ocular
deviation and a full sensorimotor examination to evaluate the function of the ocular
motor system was performed. A slit-lamp examination was significant for clear corneas
OU. There was early nuclear sclerosis in both eyes. There was a sheet like 1-2+ posterior
subcapsular cataract on the left. Dilated examination by way of cycloplegia showed
choroidal neovascularization with subretinal heme and blood in both eyes. Magnified
inspection was obtained with a Goldman 3-mirror lens and the retina, optic disc, and
retinal vasculature were visualized. Macular degeneration was present in both the left and
right retinas.
Assessment/Plan: Advanced neurovascular age-related macular degeneration OU, this is
ultimately visually limiting. Cataracts are present in both eyes. I doubt cataract removal
will help increase visual acuity; however, I did discuss with the patient, especially in the
left, that cataract surgery will help us better visualize the macula for future laser
treatment so that her current vision can be maintained. We discussed her current
regiments and decided to continue with the high doses of the vitamins A, C and E, and
the minerals zinc and copper to help slow her degeneration. After consideration the
patient agreed to left cataract surgery which we scheduled for two weeks from today.

146. Some procedures or services are commonly carried out as an integral component of
another total service or procedure and are identified by the inclusion term “separate
procedure”. Codes with this inclusion term should not be reported in addition to the total
procedure code or service to which it is considered an integral part, unless it is
independently carried out or considered unrelated. If performed independently or as an
un-related procedure it may be coded with modifier 59 appended to it.
